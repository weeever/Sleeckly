  # Fix user_stats RLS policy for INSERT operations

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop all existing policies on user_stats table
    - Create specific policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations
    - Ensure INSERT policy allows authenticated users to create their own stats
    - Maintain security by ensuring users can only access their own data

  2. Policy Details
    - SELECT: Users can read their own stats
    - INSERT: Users can create stats for themselves
    - UPDATE: Users can update their own stats  
    - DELETE: Users can delete their own stats

  This fixes the RLS violation error that occurs during user registration.
